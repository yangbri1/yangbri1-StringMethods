 * Strings are a special type of Object in Java that represent text, and they are stored a bit differently -
 * even though they are Objects, we don't need to use a constructor to instantiate them.
 *
 * Strings are actually immutable, which means that changing a string actually generates a brand new String,
 * and creating a new string that is the same as an already-existing string will just reuse the old String in memory.
